<h1>MS Azure IAM Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I walk the user through role-based access control via MS Azure. Configuring and running this lab will help develop an understanding of identity and access management. Tasks included creating user accounts, creating built-in roles, provisioning users with role assignments, designing a custom role, and assigning that custom role to a user to enforce least-privilege access. Let me know if you have any questions!
