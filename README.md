<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we walk the user through Active Directory home lab environment. Configuring and running this lab will help develop an understanding of Active Directory use cases. It's highly recommended to run through it a few times, ask questions if anything is unclear, and eventually try to build on your own to get hands on experience. Let me know if you have any questions!
